##In order to use this project, you must follow the next instructions:

 ###download the project: it can be done in different ways, for instance:

     -Copy the link located in "code" ( https://github.com/CxGarcia/thesis-project.git )

     -By using the terminal go to the folder where the project will be store, then write 
     "git clone https://github.com/CxGarcia/thesis-project.git"

     -Another option could be by using Download ZIP

 ###Once you have got everything, use your terminal to run npm install on the server and client folder, so all the dependencies  will be installed.

###Now all the dependencies are installed. However, you will also need to create new files where environment variables will be.

   On the server-side, you will need two new files:

     -.env :
     MQTT_BROKER_IP= "Broker IP"
     MQTT_PORT= "MQTT o mosquito PORT"
     WS_PORT= "Web socekt PORT"
     HTTP_PORT="HTTP or Nest.js Port"

    -ormconfig.json: this file will contain the variables related to the database, you will an example below.
    [
     {
       "type": "postgres",
       "host": "localhost",
       "name": "development",
       "port": 5432,
       "username": "xxxxxx",
       "password": "xxxxxxx",
       "database": "thesisdb",
       "entities": ["dist/**/*.entity.js"],
       "synchronize": true,
       "dropSchema": true
     },
     {
        "type": "postgres",
        "name": "test",
        "host": "localhost",
          "username": "xxxxxxx",
        "password": "xxxxxxx",
        "database": "thesistestdb",
        "entities": ["dist/**/*.entity.js"],
        "synchronize": true,
       "dropSchema": true
      }
    ]

   Lastly but no less important you must repeat this process on the client-side, creating a new file call .env:
   
      -.env 
      REACT_APP_SOCKET_HOST="URL base where the socket will send information, we used http://localhost" 
      REACT_APP_SOCKET_PORT=""Socket Port, we used 3002"
      REACT_APP_API_HOST="URL base where  Nest.js  will send information, we used http://localhost" 
      REACT_APP_API_PORT="PORT where react will work, by default its 3001 but it can be changed"

 ###Once you have the set up ready, there are different ways to make the software works, but keep in mind, it always will be done by the terminal.

    -the shortest way is by running  ###"npm run dev"  from the root folder,
    it will start the whole project, including client   and server.

  Another option is running the server and the client from different commands.
  
    -from the server folder can be run "npm start" and only the server will be working.
    -from the client folder can be run "npm start" and only the client will be working.
