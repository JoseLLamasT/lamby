It is a project where the football coaches can find a solution to show to the players some tactic plays to apply during any game.
As it has a dashboard the players will see how they must behave in the offensive and defensive moments, avoiding misunderstandings that can make the difference between being victorious or not.

The pain project was built by a colleague <a href="https://github.com/gridwork-nl">Jasja Prick</a>, then we took place during the testing and refactoring work.
Testing was applied on the back-end and front end, using technologies including types/jest, react-test-render, react-test-renderer and testing-library/jest-dom were used to test front-end while jest, mocha, chai and supertest on the back end.
Because of the testing implementation, it ensures the stability of the code in case it can be expanded or refactored.
