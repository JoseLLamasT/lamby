<h1>Lamby, Testing.</h1>

It is a project where the football coaches can find a solution to show to the players some tactic to apply during any game.
As it has a dashboard  players will see how they must behave in offensive and defensive moments, avoiding misunderstandings that can make the difference between being victorious or not.

The main project was built by <a href="https://github.com/gridwork-nl">Jasja Prick</a>, then we took place during the testing and refactoring work.

The app was built on top of React with Typescript and Sass on the front-End, and Node.js with express as a framework and PostgreSQL with Sequelize as the databases. Therefore, in order of guaranteeing the good functionality of the software, it was tested on both sides, back-end and front-end.

 <h3>Front-End</h3>
 
   - types/jest
   - react-test-render
   -  react-test-renderer
   -  testing-library
   -  jest-dom
   
<h3> Back-End</h3>

   -    jest 
   -    mocha 
   -    chai
   -    supertest

Because of the testing implementation, it ensures the stability of the code in case it can be expanded or refactored.
